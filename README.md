# Run-Love2D-from-inside-Neovim
Open your project file and execute the sequence from anywhere in the project to run the file as Love2D

Just replace your :so shortcut for this cool version that detects if you are in a Love2D project.

The coolest thing about this is that you cannot :so accidentally in files that are not Lua. Therefore, you can run code of any kind with if you use the right tools, all within ONE same shortcut.

This is my first Neovim configuration project, I hope to make many more little contributions.
